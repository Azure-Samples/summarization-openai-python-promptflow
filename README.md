# Process Automation: Speech to Text and Summarization with AI Studio

In this sample we recieve issues reported by field and shop floor workers at a company called Contoso Manufacturing, a manufacturing company that makes car batteries. The issues are shared by the workers either live through microphone input, pre-recorded as audio files or as text input. We translate audio input from speech to text and then use the text reports as input to an LLM and Prompty/Promptflow to summarize the issue and return the results in a format we specify.

# Process Automation: Speech to Text and Summarization with AI Studio

This sample uses the **[Azure AI Speech Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/)** and **[Python SDk](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/quickstarts/setup-platform?pivots=programming-language-python&tabs=macos%2Cubuntu%2Cdotnetcli%2Cdotnet%2Cjre%2Cmaven%2Cnodejs%2Cmac%2Cvscode)** to translate the users speech into text. It leverages **[Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/)** to summarize the text and **[Prompty and Prompt Flow](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/how-to-guides/develop-a-prompty/index.html)** to create, manage and evaluate the prompt into our code.

By the end of deploying this template you should be able to:

 1. Describe what Azure AI Speech Service Python SDK provides.
 2. Explain prompt creation with Prompty and Prompt Flow. 
 3. Build, run, evaluate and deploy, the summarization app to Azure.

## Features

This project template provides the following features:

* `speech_to_text.py` file that converts microphone input or pre-recorded audio to text.
* Pre-recorded audio files in the `ticket-processing/data/` folder to use for testing the app.
* `summarize.prompty` file where the prompt is constructed and edited.
* `requirements.txt` file with all the python packages needed to run this example.
* `provision.py` file to provision the resources needed to run this sample.
* A `deploy.py` to automate the deploy process using AZD.
* You will be able to use this app with Azure AI Studio

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Azure Subscription** - [Signup for a free account.](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- **Visual Studio Code** - [Download it for free.](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- **GitHub Account** - [Signup for a free account.](https://github.com/signup)
- **Access to Azure Open AI Services** - [Learn about getting access.](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access)
- **Ability to provision Azure AI Search (Paid)** - Required for Semantic Ranker

## Step 1: Development Environment

The repository is instrumented with a `devcontainer.json` configuration that can provide you with a _pre-built_ environment that can be launched locally, or in the cloud. You can also elect to do a _manual_ environment setup locally, if desired. Here are the three options in increasing order of complexity and effort on your part. **Pick one!**

 1. **Pre-built environment, in cloud** with GitHub Codespaces
 2. **Pre-built environment, on device** with Docker Desktop
 3. **Manual setup environment, on device** with Anaconda or venv

The first approach is _recommended_ for minimal user effort in startup and maintenance. The third approach will require you to manually update or maintain your local environment, to reflect any future updates to the repo.

To setup the development environment you can leverage either GitHub Codespaces, a local Python environment (using Anaconda or venv), or a VS Code Dev Container environment (using Docker).

### Step 1.1: Pre-Built Environment, in cloud (GitHub Codespaces)

**This is the recommended option.**
 - Fork the repo into your personal profile.
 - In your fork, click the green `Code` button on the repository
 - Select the `Codespaces` tab and click `Create codespace...` You can also click this button:
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/summarization-openai-python-promptflow)

This should open a new browser tab with a Codespaces container setup process running. On completion, this will launch a Visual Studio Code editor in the browser, with all relevant dependencies already installed in the running development container beneath. **Congratulations! Your cloud dev environment is ready!**

- Once you've launched Codespaces you can proceed to [step 2]().

### Step 1.2: Pre-Built Environment, on device (Docker Desktop)

This option uses the same `devcontainer.json` configuration, but launches the development container in your local device using Docker Desktop. To use this approach, you need to have the following tools pre-installed in your local device:
 - Visual Studio Code (with Dev Containers Extension)
 - Docker Desktop (community or free version is fine)

**Make sure your Docker Desktop daemon is running on your local device.** Then,
 - Fork this repo to your personal profile
 - Clone that fork to your local device
 - Open the cloned repo using Visual Studio Code

If your Dev Containers extension is installed correctly, you will be prompted to "re-open the project in a container" - just confirm to launch the container locally. Alternatively, you may need to trigger this step manually. See the [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for more information.

Once your project launches in the local Docker desktop container, you should see the Visual Studio Code editor reflect that connection in the status bar (blue icon, bottom left). **Congratulations! Your local dev environment is ready!**

- Once you've launched your docker container environment you can proceed to [step 2]().

### Step 1.3: Manual Setup Environment, on device (Anaconda or venv)

#### Local Requirements
In order to run this sample locally you will need to: 

If all of the above are correctly installed you can set up your local developer environment as follows. 

1. First, fork the repo, and then clone the code sample locally: 

   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/summarization-openai-python-promptflow.git
   ```

2. Open the repo in VS Code and navgate to the src directory

   ```bash
   cd summarization-openai-python-promptflow
   code .
   cd src
   ```

3. Install the [Prompt Flow Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prompt-flow.prompt-flow) in VS Code
      - Open the VS Code Extensions tab
      - Search for "Prompt Flow"
      - Install the extension

4. Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) for your device OS

5. Create a new local Python environment using **either** [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) **or** [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for a managed environment.

    a. **Option 1**: Using anaconda

        ```
        conda create -n summarization-promptflow python=3.11
        conda activate summarization-promptflow
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    b. **Option 2:** Using venv

        ```
        python3 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

## Step 2: Create Azure resources

We setup our development ennvironment in the previous step. In this step, we'll **provision Azure resources** for our project, ready to use for developing our LLM Application.

### 2.1 Authenticate with Azure

Start by connecting your Visual Studio Code environment to your Azure account:

1. Open the terminal in VS Code and use command `az login`. 
2. Complete the authentication flow.

**If you are running within a dev container, use these instructions to login instead:**
 1. Open the terminal in VS Code and use command `az login --use-device-code`
 1. The console message will give you an alphanumeric code
 1. Navigate to _https://microsoft.com/devicelogin_ in a new tab
 1. Enter the code from step 2 and complete the flow.

In either case, verify that the console shows a message indicating a successful authentication. **Congratulations! Your VS Code session is now connected to your Azure subscription!**

### 2.2 Provision with `provision.py`

This sample contains a `provision.py` script which will help provision the resources you need to run this sample. You specify your desired resources in the provision.yaml - there are notes in that file to help you. The script will check whether the resources you specified exist, otherwise it will create them. 

A `.env` file will be created for you that references the provisioned or attached resources, including your keys. Once the provisioning is complete, you'll be ready to move to [step 3]().

‚ùï Important: If you are viewing this README from within the cloud VS Code environment, the provisioning script will already have your subscription, hub and project details, and will extract other existing resources to set up your environment.

You can provision the resources for your app by running the following command in your terminal.

```bash
python provision.py --config provision.yaml --export-env .env --provision
```

### 2.3 Verify `.env` setup

The default sample has a `.env.sample` file in the `summarizationapp` folder that shows the relevant environment variables that need to be configured in this project. The script should create a `.env` file that has these same variables _but populated with the right values_ for your Azure resources.

If the file is not created, copy over `.env.sample` to `.env` - then populate those values manually from the respective Azure resource pages using the Azure Portal and the Azure AI Studio (for the Azure OpenAI values)

## Step 3: Explore the `summarize.prompty` file

This sample repository contains a summarize prompty file you can explore. In this sample we are telling the model to summarize the reports given by a worker in a specific format. 

The prompty file contains the following:
- The `name`, `description` and `authors` of the prompt
- `configuration`: Details about the LLM model including:
  - api type: chat or completion
  - configuration: connection type (azure_openai or openai) and environment variables
  - model parametes: max_tokesn, temperature and response_format (text or json_object)
- `inputs`: the content input from the user, where each input should have a type and can also have a default value
- `outputs`: where the output should have a type like string
- Sample Section: a sample of the inputs to be provided
- The prompt: in this sample we send add a `system message` as the prompt with context and details about the format. We also add in a `user message` at the bottom of the file, which consists of the reported issue in text format from our user. 

If you ran the provisioning step above correctly, all of the variables should already be set for you. You can edit the prompt to see what changes this makes to the summary created. 

## Step 3: Testing the sample

This repository contains sample data to be able to test the project end to end. To run this project you'll need to pass in as input a reported issue to be summarized. You can pass this input as either a `.wav` file or a string of text. The `data/audio-data/` folder contains sample audio files for you to use or you can use the example string shown below. Below are the commands you can use in your terminal to run the project locally with promptflow.

Testing with sample audio data: 
``` bash
pf flow test --flow ./summarizationapp --inputs problem="data/audio-data/issue0.wav"
```

Testing with sample text data:
``` bash
pf flow test --flow ./summarizationapp --inputs problem="I need to open a problem report for part number ABC123. The brake rotor is overheating causing glazing on the pads. We track temperature above 24 degrees Celsius and we are seeing this after three to four laps during runs when the driver is braking late and aggressively into corners. The issue severity is to be prioritized as a 2. This is impacting the front brake assembly EFG234"
```

To understand how the code works look through the `speech_to_text.py` file or watch the [demo video]() for a detailed walk through. 

## Step 4: Deploy application to AI Studio

Use the deployment script to deploy your application to Azure AI Studio. This will deploy your app to a managed endpoint in Azure, that you can test, integrate into a front end application, or share with others. Replace `<deployment_name>` with a deployment name of your choice. 

``` bash
python deploy.py --deployment-name <deployment_name>
```

## Step 5: Verify your deployment

We recommend you follow the deployment link from the previous step to the test your application in the Azure AI Studio. If you prefer to test your endpoint locally, you can invoke it.

``` bash
python invoke.py --deployment-name <deployment_name>
```

Add the `--stream` argument if you want the response to be streamed.
