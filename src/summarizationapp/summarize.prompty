    "This is Sandra, I am a test specialist assigned to ensure the carbon emissions meet specifications on the 2024 
    hybrid F150 in the Plano Texas test facility. It is 9:30 AM Feb. 23 2023. I am frequently measuring spikes in emissions 
    when the engine automatically switches from gas back to electric power. This is unexpected and exceeds the allowed emissions 
    for 3-4 seconds before returning to normal. I want to raise a high severity priority 2 problem report. I believe the issue could 
    be caused by a sensor with the part number ES001043"
