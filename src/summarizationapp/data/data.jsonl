{ "problem": "Hey it is Friday, Feb 17th afternoon.  This is Jane Doe.  I am the Test engineer assigned for testing the cabin noise levels for model DE064325.  I am at the Milford proving grounds, testing the prototype vehicle through various road conditions for last few hours.  Want to raise a problem report, as we got several readings for the cabin noise over 1000 hertz.  Our target range is between 100 and 600 hertz.  Most of the time noise seems to be coming from the front passenger side door frame, perhaps an improper sealing or excess gap.  Part number for the door frame is DR2096456.  Given excessive noise levels over prolonged periods of time, indicating sealing issues, I would report this as a high severity issue with a level 3 technical priority.  Feel free to reach out for more information.  We will continue with further testing in the next couple of days.", "chat_history": [] }
{ "problem": "Hi, this is Jake, a service technician from ACME Washer Services. I would like to report an issue with the drive belt on the Clean Series Washers launched two months ago. So far I have received 12 service calls where customers reported the part number BD5578175, Drive Belt for Tub, failed while operating the washer with a bulk load setting. Customer typically observe this failure during the rinse cycle. On further inspection, I noticed that the failure also impacted BP9900376, Drive Pulley for Tub, causing it to crack. Given the high cost of parts and labor to service this issue, I would like to report this as technical priority 1 with a severity of high, since customers are unable to use their washers until it is repaired. We are also replacing the damaged parts with equivalent replacement parts but our company believes that the belts need to be re-designed for durability. Please reach out to us if you need more details on this issue", "chat_history": [] }

{ "problem": "This is Sandra, I am a test specialist assigned to ensure the carbon emissions meet specifications on the 2024 hybrid F150 in the Plano Texas test facility. It is 9:30 AM Feb. 23 2023. I am frequently measuring spikes in emissions when the engine automatically switches from gas back to electric power.
